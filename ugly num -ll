Given an integer n,  return the nth ugly number.

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3 and 5.

Examples:

Input: n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: Ugly Numbers - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. So, 5th Ugly Number is 5
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 10th Ugly Number is 12
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1500
class Solution:
    # Function to find the nth ugly number.
    def uglyNumber(self, n):
        arr = [0] * n
        ind2 = ind3 = ind5 = 0
        mulTwo = 2
        mulThree = 3
        mulFive = 5
        nextNum = 1
        arr[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            nextNum = min(mulTwo, mulThree, mulFive)
            arr[i] = nextNum
            if nextNum == mulTwo:
                ind2 += 1
                mulTwo = arr[ind2] * 2
            if nextNum == mulThree:
                ind3 += 1
                mulThree = arr[ind3] * 3
            if nextNum == mulFive:
                ind5 += 1
                mulFive = arr[ind5] * 5
        return nextNum
